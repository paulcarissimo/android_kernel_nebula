NOTE TO SELF
-----


nebula kernel till v2.6 was excellent in battery backup as well as performance.

But v2.8 and v2.9 were not so good in performance even though battery backup
was good. Antutu scores were less in comparison to v2.6 (not that the scores
show a complete picture). Phone seemed a bit slow too.

F2FS support in v2.8 and v2.9 had nothing do with it. 

I could have reverted the the commits for v3.00, but that would have been messy. 

I moved v2.x to a new branch and rebased 'nebula-4.4' branch for v3.00
on v2.6 without the intermediate commits (except F2FS).

'nebula-4.4' (main) branch was kept clean.
